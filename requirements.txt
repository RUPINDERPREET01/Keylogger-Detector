# Keylogger-Detector (Prototype)

## Objective
Lightweight heuristic-based detector to demonstrate detecting suspicious processes and file-writing behaviour associated with keyloggers.

## Components
- detector.py — main monitoring/detection script
- simulator_writer.py — safe simulator to test detection (writes dummy logs)
- NOTES.md — heuristics and tuning
- detector_logs/alerts.log — generated runtime alerts

## How to run
1. Create and activate venv (see project docs)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python detector.py
4. (Optional) simulate suspicious behavior: python simulator_writer.py

## Caution
This is a research/demo tool. Not production-ready. Does not detect all keyloggers and may produce false positives. For robust detection use system/endpoint protection tools and OS-specific APIs.
